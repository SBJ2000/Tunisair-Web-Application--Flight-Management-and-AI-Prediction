## Project Description

This project showcases the development of a web application for Tunisair, an airline company. The primary objective of the application is to simplify and optimize the management of flights, cabin crew, and in-flight catering partners. Moreover, the project incorporates an artificial intelligence module for predicting flight delays, contributing to better planning and a smoother travel experience for passengers.

This readme file provides an overview of the project, highlighting key features like flight scheduling, crew management, catering partner management, and delay prediction. The technologies employed in the development include Angular and Spring Boot for the frontend and backend respectively. JWT is utilized to ensure data security, while the AI model is based on Catboost Regressor.

The file also delves into the architecture and design of the application, offering detailed insights into the various components, their interactions, and integration. Additionally, it discusses design choices, data models, and workflows that form the foundation of the application.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

![JDK](https://img.shields.io/badge/JDK-1.8-blue) 

    Java Development Kit (JDK): Install JDK to run Spring Boot, as it is a Java-based framework.

![Spring Boot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring%20Boot-2.5.0-green)

    Spring Boot: Set up and configure Spring Boot for your backend development. You can use Spring Initializr to generate a new Spring Boot project.
![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-12.0.0-red)

     Angular CLI: Install Angular CLI to create and manage your Angular frontend application. It provides useful commands for development and building Angular projects.
![JWT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Authentication-JWT-green)

    JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Familiarize yourself with the concepts of JWT and how to implement JWT-based authentication and authorization in your Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend.
![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/Database-MySQL-blue)

    Database: Determine the database you will use for your project. Spring Boot supports various databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and H2 (for development purposes), in this project I used MySQL Datebase.
![IntelliJ IDEA](https://img.shields.io/badge/IDE-IntelliJ%20IDEA-blue)
![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/IDE-Visual%20Studio%20Code-blue)
   
     IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Choose an IDE of your preference for coding. For example in this project I used IntelliJ for Spring Boot & Visual Studio Code for Angular.

![Catboost Regressor](https://img.shields.io/badge/ML%20Model-Catboost%20Regressor-orange)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue)

    Catboost Regressor: Understand the Catboost Regressor model and its implementation. Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries and dependencies installed for working with Catboost, such as Catboost.
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version%20Control-Git-red)

    Git: Use Git for version control and managing your project's source code. Set up a Git repository to track changes and collaborate with other team members if needed.
![Maven](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build%20Tool-Maven-blue)
![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/Package%20Manager-npm-red)

    Package Managers: Use Maven for managing dependencies in your Spring Boot project and npm (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies in your Angular project.
### Installation

For the back end part using Spring Boot , you need to have these dependecies :
![Spring Boot Dependecies](https://github.com/SBJ2000/Tunisair-Web-Application--Flight-Management-and-AI-Prediction/blob/main/Images/Spring%20Boot%20Dependecies.png)

And to install them you can use this commande line: "mvn clean install", then run your Back-end application using  the start button from the IDE.


In the angular project you need to have this ones:
![Angular Dependecies](https://github.com/SBJ2000/Tunisair-Web-Application--Flight-Management-and-AI-Prediction/blob/main/Images/Angular%20Dependencies.png)

And to install them you can use the commande line : "npm install", then you can run your application using the commaned: "ng serve".
